# Kaggle Competitions Repository

This is where I keep all of the code used for various Kaggle competitions. Each directory on this level corresponds to a different competition. The list here is in chronological order of working on them.

* Titanic: Predicting survival of titanic passengers
* House Prices: Predicting the sale price of houses
