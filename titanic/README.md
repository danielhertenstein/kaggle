# The Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset

This competition dataset contains passenger information for passengers on the titanic. Some died, others didn't. The goal of the competition is to develop a model that will predict whether or not a given passenger survived.

This is the first competition I worked on, so the code is not organized. I took a stab on my own at first, then read a bunch of discussion threads to learn what the best techniques and approaches were. Because of this, all of my code is contained within a single notebook, `main.ipynb` and is nowhere near as organized as it could be. I don't plan on going back and prettying this up as this code is for me. If you go and look at the house_prices directory, you'll see a much more organized and methodical approach now that I have a better understanding of how to approach these competitions.

The notebook `kernel.ipynb` is a short notebook containing only the minimum necessary steps to create the model I used for submission.
